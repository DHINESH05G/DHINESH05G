# Historic-Inscriptions-Recognition

The Historic-Inscriptions-Recognition Ancient Tamil Script is one of the earliest known writing systems evidenced in many parts of India by Epigraphic records found on Rock edicts and Hero stones.Although these inscriptions are a rich source of history, very few applications have been developed to recognize and translate ancient Tamil Script characters.This is mainly due to the lack of proper datasets and very few experts on these long-lost ancient scripts. Furthermore, most stone inscriptions are in conditions that require Image enhancement and Noise removal after the capture of the image. The objective of this project is to develop an architecture to deal with unknown scripts in a systematic way and to curate a dataset necessary for future work. In addition, the aim of this project is to come up with an approach that overcomes 
the challenges of dealing with stone inscriptions to make it easier to translate them, using Convolutional Neural Networks and other Deep Learning techniques.
